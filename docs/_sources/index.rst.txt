Welcome to **euchar**'s documentation!
============================================

This is the documentation of the ``euchar`` Python package.

``euchar`` provides Python bindings to C++ algorithms for the
computation of Euler characteristic curves and Euler characteristic
surfaces of

- 2D and 3D images, i.e. matrices of integers in some range ``[0, m]``
- 2D and 3D finite point sets.

Installation
--------------

For the package to install correctly the prerequisites are

- ``CMake`` version >= 3.5
- ``pybind11`` version >= 2.2

This package makes use of features provided by the following Python packages

- ``numpy``
- ``matplotlib``, used in the ``display`` module of the package
- ``scipy``, used to obtain Delaunay triangulations of 2D and 3d finite point sets
- ``scikit-learn``, for nearest neighbours algorithm to obtain an estimate of the inverse of the local density in a finite set of points

``euchar`` can be installed with

``pip install euchar``

Examples
----------

- :ref:`Usage example: Euler characteristic curves`
- :ref:`Usage example: Euler characteristic surfaces`

The same usage examples can also be found in the ``/notebooks/``
directory of the github page of the project in the form of Jupyter
notebooks.

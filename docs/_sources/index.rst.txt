Welcome to **euchar**'s documentation!
============================================

**NOTE: this project is work in progress!**

This is the documentation of the ``euchar`` Python package.

``euchar`` provides Python bindings to C++ implementations for computing the Euler characteristic curves and Euler characteristic surfaces of given images or finite point sets, in the two and three dimensional case.

--------------

This package requirements are

- ``CMake`` version >= 3.5
- ``pybind11`` version >= 2.2
- ``numpy``
- ``matplotlib``, used in the ``display`` module of the package
- ``scipy``, used to obtain Delaunay triangulations of 2D and 3d finite point sets
- ``scikit-learn``, for nearest neighbours alogrithm

The package can be installed via ``pip`` with

``$ pip install euchar``

Examples
----------

See the ``github`` page of the package at ``https://github.com/gbeltramo/euchar``.

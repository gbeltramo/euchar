Welcome to **euchar**'s documentation!
============================================

This is the documentation of the ``euchar`` Python package.

``euchar`` provides Python bindings to C++ implementations for computing the Euler characteristic curves and Euler characteristic surfaces of given images or finite point sets, in the two and three dimensional case.

Installation
--------------

For the package to install correctly the prerequisites are

- ``CMake`` version >= 3.5
- ``pybind11`` version >= 2.2

This module makes use of features provided by the following Python modules

- ``numpy``
- ``matplotlib``, used in the ``display`` module of the package
- ``scipy``, used to obtain Delaunay triangulations of 2D and 3d finite point sets
- ``scikit-learn``, for nearest neighbours algorithm to obtain an estimate of the inverse of the local density in a finite set of points

``euchar`` can be installed with the following command

``$ pip install euchar``

Examples
----------

See the ``github`` page of the package at ``https://github.com/gbeltramo/euchar``.
  
Examples can be found in the ``/notebooks/`` directory in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
